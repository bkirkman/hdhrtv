HDHRTV - a streaming server for the HDHomeRun PRIME cable tuner that can
stream a native MPEG2 TS stream or transcoded flash stream. MythTV program
listings can be displayed if a MythTV server is available.


1. Disclaimer

HDHRTV is a hobby project that has been developed to serve a need but not
be a perfect body of code. It most likely will contain bugs. Please note that
security is ultimately the responsibility of the person installing software
on a server. It is highly encouraged to secure any public facing server with
password protection and encryption. 

The transcoding and streaming method used by HDHRTV is rather crude and
simplistic. The possibility exists that FFmpeg processes could become orphaned
when streams are not cleanly initiated or closed. Please check for orphaned
FFmpeg processes on a regular basis if the streaming server is being regularly used. 


2. Overview

The HDHomeRun PRIME is a CableCard tuner device capable of HTTP streaming the
native MPEG2 TS digital cable stream tuned by the device over a network.
Unfortunately, this stream is typically too large to stream over WiFi or outside
the local network, though the native standard definition stream will stream okay,
in most cases, over WiFi on the local network. In order to allow streaming to any
location, HDHRTV transcodes the MPEG stream to a flash video and streams it via a
web page. Though Apple devices have embraced HTML 5 and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS),
it seems that the rest of the world is slow to get on board. Android seems to only
have mild success with HLS depending on what 3rd party applications have been
installed. As such, HDHRTV has been developed to stream Flash until the rest of the
OS world catches up to HTML 5 and HLS streaming. If interested in setting up an HLS
server for the HDHomeRun PRIME, consider using Wallop (http://jonmaddox.com/wallop/).
For direct streaming using Android device, consider using MX Player or Daroon Player.
Standard definition flash streaming should work on nearly any server. HD channels
will require that a decent, modern processor be used for transcoding. Also note that
a couple of ffmpeg configurations have been set up in the configuration file. One
uses the original Sorenson flv codec. This codec cannot multithread, so it will 
most likely not be effective transcoding HD channels. The other ffmpeg configuration
uses h.264 video and mp3 audio in an flv container. This configuration is capable
of multithreading and should be able to transcode HD video.

5. Requirements

- HDHomeRun PRIME capable of HTTP streaming
- Apache or similar webserver
- PHP >= 5.1
- FFmpeg
- MythTV (optional for channel listings and info)

Development system: CentOS 6.4, Apache 2.2.15, PHP 5.3.3, MythTV .26,
FFmpeg 1.2.4, HDHomeRun Prime.


6. Features

Main Page / Listing:
- The main home page lists all the channels available.
  If MythTV is being used, then the channel data and
  listing info will be retrieved from MythTV. If MythTV
  is not being used, then channel data will be retrieved
  from the HDHomeRun. The HDHomeRun only provides channel
  number and name.
- Channel icons can be shown on the channel listings.
  Icons are configured in ./config/channel_icon_map.php.
  Icons reside in ./public/images/channel_icons/
- The play button on the left can be configured to start
  the flash player or provide a direct HTTP link to the
  HDHomeRun PRIME.
- If the direct link to the stream is selected, the client
  device must be configured to play this link. On Android,
  consider using MX Player or Daroon. On a standard computer,
  consider VLC.

Channel Details:
- The channel details page is shown when selecting the arrow
  on the right of an individual channel on the listings page.
  The detail page will show information for the selected
  channel. If MythTV listings are being used, program details
  and start/stop time will be shown. From this details page,
  the user can select a link to play the channel via a direct
  URL or via the flash player.  

Settings:
- The user can adjust general and transcoding settings.
  The settings are stored in a user cookie. If cookies
  aren't enabled, then the default settings defined in the
  config file will be used. 


7. Installation

- Extract the files to a directory on your webserver.
- Check and adjust file and directory permissions.
- Make any additional adjustments to the server as necessary for the specific
  application directory, such as password protection, etc.  
- Edit ./config/config.php. The config file contains three sections. The first
  section contains the application settings, all defined in the $config[] array.
  The next section contains the ffmpeg transcoding settings, all defined in the
  $ffmpeg_cmd[] array. The last section contains the user settings, the
  respective setting's selections, and the default setting, all within a nested
  array defined by the $user_config[] array.
- All of the config file settings are well documented.
- Edit the ./config/channel_icon_map.php file to assign channel icon images to
  channel numbers. Add channel icon images to ./public/images/channel_icons 
  as necessary.


8. Tips and Tricks

- For direct streaming to Android, there has been success with both MX Player and
  Daroon Player depending on the hardware and Android version.
- If HDHRTV is running on a server without enough processing power, it is possible 
  to use ssh and have another machine with greater processing capabilities take care of
  transcoding. Revise the ffmpeg command lines from 'ffmpeg' to 'ssh user@remote ffmpeg'
  in the config file. The remote machine will transfer its standard output to the server
  running HDHRTV. Remote ssh keys will need to be set up to allow for apache, or whatever
  user is used to run the webserver, to connect to the remote machine and execute ffmpeg.

9. Known issues

- The php web page uses a very simple 'passthru' command to stream the output of ffmpeg
  to the web page's flash player. If the server has issues transcoding or streaming
  the video, the php page will stop responding and the ffmpeg process will be orphaned.
  If an ffmpeg process is orphaned, it typically won't increase the server's load. The
  server administrator should 'ps aux | grep ffmpeg' for orphaned ffmpeg processes from
  time to time and clean up as necessary.


10. Possible TODO Items

- Monitor for ophaned ffmpeg processed and terminate gracefully if discovered.
  Consider usind PID files.
- Add user option to terminate any orphaned ffmpeg processes.
- Add more options and information to Flowplayer, such as 'now playing',
  adjust bitrate, mini-EPG. Mini-EPG could be a menu of favorite channels.
